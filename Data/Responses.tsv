I imagine that they may have encountered potential stumbling blocks in the past that I may not have considered.	Reluctant	Reviewing papers is already a non-negligible time commitment. I'm concerned that many researchers might not have the availability to also volunteer registered report reviews if there was suddenly a large influx of them.	Eager	I wonder if some user studies are more likely to need a registered report, while others might not really be in need of one. For example, are certain sample sizes, or types of data, more susceptible to HAARK-ing or unexpected outcomes?	Somehow interested

07/10/2021 18:59:41	Yes	> 10 years	I have a good understanding of what it is	0 pre-registration	I have never heard of it	Reasonably well	Somewhat helpful	I have deep concerns about this as applied to qualitative research. While there are obviously methods to ensure rigor in qualitative work, they are quite different from quantitative studies and cannot be specified all in advance. It is the very nature of qualitative research that the subject of interest can adapt and change as the study progresses. Therefore the whole notion of pre-registration is out of alignment with this approach to research. Furthermore, I am deeply concerned that efforts that make preregistration (and registered reports) an expectation in vis will further marginalize qualitative research studies, which are already marginalized.	Neutral		Neutral	I really don't write many papers of this nature any more. Most of my work is qualitative and does not fit this structure.	Rather not interested	See my concerns above about marginalizing other types of empirical research.

We ask researchers we trust what they think about our design.	Very eager	If it's short and structured I'd be more than happy. It's fun and useful.	Very eager		Very interested	
07/10/2021 21:15:35	Yes	> 10 years	I have a good understanding of what it is	0 pre-registration	I have a good understanding of what it is	Very well	Helpful	Certainly, it would allow you pre-clear your study plans with the reviewers, reducing the risk of unexpected reviewer surprises, and hopefully catching errors in your design.	Reluctant	Increased workload for reviewers (more stuff to review).	Reluctant	I feel that this increases workload in such a way that it would not be beneficial. 	Rather not interested	I'm not opposed to them being part of the community, but I would likely choose not to participate on either end.
08/10/2021 02:24:49	Yes	> 10 years	I have a good understanding of what it is	0 pre-registration	I have never heard of it	Reasonably well	Helpful	Not all research contributions are part of a quantitative study. 	Neutral		Eager	I'm sick of having studies picked apart on minute details after they are already completed. Feedback would be most welcome. 	Somehow interested	I would not want this to replace the openness of other types of papers that are accepted at VIS. This seems to make sense for controlled experiments, but not design studies, systems papers, etc.
08/10/2021 07:28:39	Yes	< 5 years	I have a good understanding of what it is	1 to 5 pre-registrations	I have a vague notion of what it means	Not very well	Very helpful	I think it would be nice as it would increase confidence in one's own analysis as it has been provisionally accepted in peer review. That said, this does depend on the quality of said peer review. A poor stage 1 peer review that is not rigorously performed is likely to be just as bad as an unregistered report with questionable research practices, as it can instill a false sense of confidence in readers.	Eager	It would certainly be nice as it reduces the level of scrutiny required on the analysis portion of the report, allowing a reviewer (or me) to focus more on the research contributions and applications. However, as mentioned above, this might incentivise sloppier reviewing where reviewers may just assume that since it's registered already, the analysis does not need to be inspected in detail a second time. Maybe if the reviewers during stage 2 do not know that it was preregistered? Not sure.	Neutral	Really depends on the research I'm doing. If the work is highly exploratory, then there wouldn't be much value in doing so. If the work had strict hypotheses and experimental conditions, then I would definitely consider it, especially if a fellow co-author was in favour of it.	Very interested	The concept of RRs seems nice as it allows for more straightfoward pathways into having work be published, minimising the effects of publish or perish, while also increasing scientific rigour.  I do wonder about the practicalities of it though. This is a very naive take, but I'd be curious if the burden of rejecting papers will shift from post-analysis to pre-analysis, such that 75% of papers will keep being rejected in the stage 1 peer review. Probably unlikely, but you never know.

The methods we use change as the study proceeds based upon what we learn. I couldn't imagine having to decide a-priori as to what the specific methods are that we would employ over a longitudinal study. 	Reluctant	My expertise is not in areas that lend themselves to nifty statistics and controlled environments.	Very reluctant	I would have selected NA if that option had been available.

13/10/2021 13:37:55	Yes	5 to 10 years	I have a vague notion of what it means	1 to 5 pre-registrations	I have never heard of it	Reasonably well	Somewhat helpful	While most reviewers are reasonable, there are often reviewers who believe the purpose of a review is to oppose one’s own view onto the authors. Failing to continue with the work because of unreasonable reviewers seems to make the whole process even more time consuming. I see this to be an issue for PhD student who have limited time and funding.	Neutral		Reluctant	Increasing time effort and the potential for unreasonable reviews make me reluctant.	Rather not interested	Implementing two review approaches seems odd. Either nobody chooses that option as it takes longer or everyone chooses it as papers submitted to the normal review process will judged harder (due to the missing pre-review).

13/10/2021 13:58:56	Yes	< 5 years	I have a good understanding of what it is	1 to 5 pre-registrations	I have a vague notion of what it means	Very well	Helpful	My relative conservatism with respect to the previous questions comes from the fact that I have never done it before. I see that we need to develop some different kind of expertise in writing and evaluating registered reports. The community also needs to build some guidelines and effective procedures.  Some thoughts or suggestions: - Reviewer's comments could be conflicting or suggest changes that are practically infeasible or disagree with researchers' intuition or goals (a reason might be that their submission was not completely clear). Allowing authors to respond fast and get new feedback might be important so that the agreed studies are not problematic. (reviewers are not necessarily more experts than the actual authors).    - The direct acceptance condition worries me a bit as it is often hard to identify a problematic study just based on its description. Small variations in experimental instructions or in an experimental apparatus can make a hue difference. As a reviewer, I may only realize a huge problem by looking on the reported results (or the raw data). See also my comments below. 	Eager	I am curious and interested. But still, this is something new to me. I think that the authors should be given much more space for describing their methodology  and the reviewing requirements for study methodologies will become stricter. My role now would be to give precise feedback about the experimental methodology and I would feel more responsible for possible failures. So the responsibility of the reviewer is greater, and of course, this requires additional reviewing time. This should be taken into consideration.	Eager	Again, I'm interested in exploring this possibility but not for all my papers. I think that for some type of research, this would be a very interesting direction. But not for others.  	Somehow interested	Yes, but as a complementary publication model (possibly exploratory as a first step as the community becomes more aware of its strengths and weaknesses).  (Note: it took me 40 minutes to answer the questionnaire.)

Neutral	My reviewing load is already high and I do not see how to reduce it.

Would need this to be more reliable than current non-conference reviewing which can unpredictably take between a couple of weeks and over a year.	Neutral	I probably have insufficient experience always to be confident in assessing statistical validity of some reports.	Eager	Would be useful if method review period not too long.	Somehow interested	Would like to see 'failed' studies in particular. ie. those with credible methodology but whose findings do not support initial hypotheses being investigated.

This is again likely to be highly dependent on which reviewer you get. I can't help but wonder how important this is for research that is gathering empirical evidence mostly for the purpose of validating visualization designs and interaction techniques...

13/10/2021 15:17:45	Yes	> 10 years	I have never heard of it	0 pre-registration	I have a vague notion of what it means	Reasonably well	Not helpful at all	A study requires some design and an iterative approach, at least in the areas I work in. Early findings provide insight as to what the true research questions are, and prompt toward the proper design to obtain refutable facts. A pre-registration is almost guaranteed to overtly constrain the research to reinforce preconceptions. There may be knowledge areas where it is justified. But it is a very bad idea in general for the conduct of science. 	Very reluctant	Sounds extremely tedious and not very useful. I already review funding request and research grants, which follow a similar pattern: authors explain what they want to do and we decide of funding based on what they propose. But we know that the work that will end up being done will be vastly different. Managing research funding under these constraints is already quite frustrating, I don't want to  further encourage these approach in research and innovation.	Reluctant	I already write research grants. That's enough overselling for me.	Not interested at all	
13/10/2021 15:18:17	Yes	> 10 years	I have a vague notion of what it means	0 pre-registration	I have never heard of it	Reasonably well	Somewhat helpful		Reluctant	I would rather present my ideas as a workshop presentation / short paper / poster	Reluctant	1. time to get reviews; 2. sometimes reviews are not very constructive	Rather not interested	so far, I observe mostly negative impact in changes introduced to VIS. It is easy to break something working, but is quite difficult to create something useful
13/10/2021 15:25:56	Yes	> 10 years	I have a good understanding of what it is	1 to 5 pre-registrations	I have a good understanding of what it is	Very well	Helpful	On the one hand, I'm supportive of the idea of registered reports: they provide a sanity check on the soundness of a proposed study and can lower barriers to engaging in experimental research to people just getting involved in such study. On the other, they can lead to a false sense of complacency. Any experiment has potential confounds. While the registered report approach can catch some potential confounds or methodological flaws, the somewhat implicit (if unintentional) assertion that work adhering to the methods in an accepted report will be "sound" can give a false sense of security that may lead to complacency in investigating confounds after an experiment has been conducted. In other words, theory is different from practice. We often don't know how substantive any trade-off, flaw, or confound might be until execution or analysis.  	Neutral	Reviewers are already under heavy load. While the experimental visualization community is growing, the pool of reviewers with expertise in experimental methods is still relatively small. For those of us already reviewing 60+ manuscripts per year, the idea of significantly increasing the review load feels daunting both for reviewers and for editors/people seeking out reviewers.	Neutral	There are questions where the experimental methods are tricky (or even part of the contribution), in which case having additional input on the methods would be helpful. Other experiments are pretty straightforward, and having an expectation of prior methodological review would simply be yet another delay in the process of getting the results to the research community.	Neutral	While I support the idea in theory, I worry that an expectation would develop that all experimental work should require registered reports, in much the same way certain kinds of domain-oriented work are now pushed towards the corresponding satellite event rather than the core conference. This pressure is social rather than formal, so I'm not sure there's any way to avoid it.

13/10/2021 17:13:41	Yes	5 to 10 years	I have a vague notion of what it means	0 pre-registration	I have never heard of it	Reasonably well	Somewhat helpful	Pre-registration and (if I understand registered reports correctly?) make a lot of sense for pure positivist research that privileges the scientific method over other epistemologies. However, for interpretivist work such as grounded theory—where the methods themselves are deliberately ad hoc, and the objective is often to arrive at a rigorous hypothesis, instead of generalizable results—pre-registration makes less sense. I once attempted to pre-register a grounded theory investigation on OSF.io, but the fit was really weird, and ultimately felt like a huge waste of time trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. Yes, I know it's possible to announce the basics "I'm going to do grounded theory about broad topic X and follow Y framework for coding, etc." However, at least in some schools of thought, trying to anticipate too much about what your study will find before you find it (and how you'll adjust your methods accordingly) subverts the whole point of such a study. This isn't to say I don't appreciate the value of pre-registration, etc., for positivist research, but whenever its proponents start posturing as gatekeepers or using words like "mandatory," I tend to get very uncomfortable.  (EDIT after seeing the next page: I think it's *very* interesting that this survey itself is only "quasi-registered." The authors should probably carefully consider WHY this survey itself was hard to fully pre-register!)	Neutral	Re: "how willing" ... I picked "Neutral" because it really depends on the kind of study. For positivist research, I'd say "Very eager;" but for interpretivist research, I'd say "Very reluctant"	Neutral	See previous comment	Neutral	A lot of my response would depend on what is meant / implied by "new and complementary"

Neutral	I feel like it's important for the community to do effective research, but not clear whether peer review is the appropriate mechanism for this.	Neutral	Same as above (do this already without extensive peer review and it woudl slow the process).	Neutral

Neutral	Depends on the quality/arguments of the review, of course. As an author I would do it. As a supervisor of an author I would like to be as sure as possible that the potential additional cycle pays off.

Neutral	Sometimes the incomplete nature might make the review harder and less engaging, but judging design quality may be easier when not conflated with findings.	Eager	Suggestions may improve the study before it is too late, post-mortem comments can only improve the analysis and presentation.	Somehow interested	Designing a study is cheaper than carrying it out, and there may be a flood of registered reports attempting to get expertise for free. Unless there is a mechanism to enforce serious and honest preparation, or quick dismissal of study designs, the opportunity for exploitation is a problem. Second, it seems good practice that authors can have their registered reports become publically available to prevent others implementing the study they designed. An acceptable practice would be a study following and citing a published design.

Reluctant	There is such variability among user study reviewers, that I would be reluctant to do a review myself. Meaning, reviewers don't agree even on basic issues like p-value reports, and I don't think reviewers hailing from a deeply compromised field (e.g., behavioral psychology, known for p-hacking) are qualified to dictate terms to anyone else (e.g., biostatisticians, not known for p-hacking).

These subsequent studies tend to branch out like trees, and often it's impossible to map out every path before the data is collected and analyzed. However, this is not to say that having the study reviewed prior isn't helpful - we do versions of that within our labs and with other colleagues, it's just studies tend to be more unpredictable.

Very eager	Much like with my PhD students, it's more fulfilling to give advice before or during the work. Not after.	Eager		Neutral

14/10/2021 21:56:40	Yes	> 10 years	I have never heard of it	0 pre-registration	I have never heard of it	Not very well	Somewhat helpful	It seems that the main idea here is to help researchers new to a field to get expert opinions before spending their time working on a problem that is either too hard, too narrow, or otherwise risky. I can see this is a useful path for some type of research. However, I am not sure this would be universally useful. 	Neutral	I'd be happy to provide early feedback to young researchers in terms of their new ideas. However, there is a risk of a seasoned researcher being a nay-sayer, which can discourage the younger researchers. 	Reluctant	For certain type of research, I"d be happy to seek expertise opinions. My concern is what type of credits would the reviewers get. That is, should they be considered as co-authors if they brought up some exciting directions in their reviews. 	Neutral	I do not feel that I know enough of this model to have a strong opinion. This might be similar to SIGGRAPH Tech briefs, where an idea and some prototype work is reviewed, before the authors can make a more complete paper from the technical brief. If that is the case, i.e. both the technical brief (RR) and the full paper can be published, then I am for this.

Reluctant	Time constraints. 	Eager	I think if we can plan it early, I would like to go this way. However, it also really depends on the timing and the quality of the reviews.	Neutral	I think one benefit is that the RR model and reduce the bias of study results. I have got reviews that saying "the results are not very exciting thus the paper should be rejected". I believe with RR, such situations can be improved. However, I am not confident of getting enough qualified reviewers who are willing to get involved. The RR model seems to put a lot of extra service load to people.

For example, they should demonstrate (using artificial data) how they would visualize results.  The quality of a paper is not "only" the conceptualization, but also the presentation, which is hard to gauge when no data is available.	Very eager		Very interested	
15/10/2021 01:19:27	Yes	< 5 years	I have a good understanding of what it is	1 to 5 pre-registrations	I have a vague notion of what it means	Perfectly	Very helpful	Our experimental protocol, user study and analysis follows what we pre-registered. I believe this practice should be encouraged for every scientific research and makes the experiment more convincing as the hypothesis should not occur after data collection commences.	Eager	I believe pre-registration makes the experiment more convincing as the hypothesis should come from research questions and not biased by the data collection. Secondly, reviewing both the pre-registration and the final report gives an idea where the authors make change to e.g., the number of participants recruited, the statistics models used for the analysis, and the hypotheses. 	Very eager	I believe this practice should be encouraged for every scientific research and makes the experiment more convincing as the hypothesis should not occur after data collection commences. The first stage review allows us to refine the experiment before the data collection commences, which makes the experimental protocol more robust.	Somehow interested	This would benefit the viz community, making the experiment design more robust as it is reviewed at the first stage.

Today, open discussion of unpublished work is hardly possible. So, registered reports might come in handy.	Somehow interested	Depends on the type of research to be published.
